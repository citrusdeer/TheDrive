I can't tell you what to download, thats up to personal preference.
But heres some things to keep in mind:
- get some things you've never seen
- get some things you're unsure if you'll like, you never know
- keep in mind your friends and family and their tastes, its not all about you
- old favorites and comfort shows
- kids shows (for distracting the loud and destructive little ones)
- classics (seinfeld/fraiser/friends/breaking bad/etc) (because these things are referenced often in other media)

Also keep in mind that you dont need 4K for 90s shows.
4K didn't exist yet, and you're wasting valuable disk space, DVD quality is perfectly good.
Same goes for animated shows, even very low resolutions look perfectly fine, theres not as
much detail to begin with.
