I can't tell you what to download, thats up to personal preference.
But heres some things to keep in mind:
- get some things you've never seen
- get some things you're unsure if you'll like, you never know
- keep in mind your friends and family and their tastes, its not all about you
- old favorites and comfort shows
- kids shows (for distracting the loud and destructive little ones)
- classics (seinfeld/fraiser/friends/breaking bad/etc) (because these things are referenced often in other media)
