As discussed in the top level readme, text is incredibly information dense, but
also incredibly entertainment dense! you could fit entire series and anthologies,
hundreds of hours of entertainment in the same space as a single 1080p 30 minute episode.

The books folder should ideally:
- be the smallest folder in media/ (because entire books are MB at best)
- have the most files by a large margin

Really, dont skimp out here, download every book you can get your hands on!
