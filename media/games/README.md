the apocalypse will likely be very stressful.
Games are important for relaxing, decompressing,
creativity, team building and comraderie, etc.
Don't overlook them!

You're going to want:
- console game ROMs (dont forget to get the proper emulators)
- pc games

but also:
- board games
- card games

for these you can just download the cards/boards and rulebooks.
