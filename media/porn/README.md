I know what you're thinking.
"Porn? really? is that really important right now?!"

Yup! Remember, we're planning for an apocalypse,
"the internet goes away and never comes back" scenario.

Humans are sexual creatures and porn makes up close to a third of all internet traffic!
It's easy to overlook, but important that we meet the needs of humans.
*ALL* needs. you will regret it in a year.

That said, theres none in this repo out of respect for githubs policy and your personal
preferences, but don't forget to download some. If you are preparing this drive for
more than just yourself, ensure you cover the bases and appeal to the whole audience,
covering a wide range of sexualities and preferences.

Don't go overboard, you will likely spend much more time watching movies and shows,
youtube videos, playing games, reading books, etc.

It should be a small minority of what you download.
Porn is not the biggest priority,
but it should not be overlooked entirely.
