# Specs as data

This is a bit of a weirder rabbit hole.

I think people tend to think of the physical and digital realms
as separate. Theres bits and matter and they are apart.

But I don't.
Ive come to see blueprints and specs as equivilant to their finished product.
A digital embodiment of the physical.

Things have become so commoditized that when you need a small box, or a bracket,
an adapter, or even a device, we turn to amazon. And in 2 days, sometimes overnight, we
have it. And when that box is just 2cm too small, or the device requires you to use
their shitty app that phones back home to china, we accept that as just how it is.

When the bracket doesn't exist (or they just refuse to sell it to you) we give up, and
buy a new dishwasher for $100s when all you needed was
$0.20 of plastic.

Fuck that!

# STLs + Filament = Physical

As a programmer, I've come to see STLs (and especially parametric CAD files) as the same
as the finished product. Needing only the time and energy to deposit the filament in the proper
place. Hell, you'll have the thing faster than even 2 day shipping could achieve!
Its like programming the physical world.

# Arduino and ESP32

More important than the microcontroller, which are readily available and cheap,
is the code running on it.
I shouldnt have to tell you code is data files.
You can build anything you need. Somebody probably already has.
Enough said.

# Gerber Files (PCBs as files)

With on-demand PCB ordering from PCBWay or JLCPCB and others,
now even the board and the components are data to be saved,
but more importantly, they are designed with your needs in mind,
not to lock you into some ecosystem or to streamline their process to save $0.02/piece

Again, This isnt about designing ever single board in every single device.
This is about considering FOSS hardware, and whether that Amazon seller with no vowels
really added any magic sauce that doesnt exist elsewhere, free to use.

The added bonus is that every product has all the features you want, none you dont,
and are significantly cheaper with no middlemen extracting their cut or branding
ugly logos and using anti-consumer triangular screws to stop you from fixing your
alarm clock.

# Wood and metal

Obviously I can't fit the actual materials into a flash drive.
But how to assemble those, in what order, the blueprints and specs, hell yea.
Where possible and economical, I prefer 2020 or 4040 extruded aluminum and 2x4s.

This repo will (hopefully and eventually) contain desks, cabinets, shelves, lathes,
garden beds, mounts, and other things that are typically not considered "files"

# Conclusion

This repo contains not just information and knowledge, but also
objects, machines, tools, tools that make tools, and anything you can imagine.
(if you can imagine something not covered, please make a PR! Sharing is caring!)
