# The Drive

This is a self-hosting/data-hoarding project to the extreme.
This is not a convienent project, but an important one,
that frees you from the ever increasing tyranny of technofeudalism.

You've just lost internet.
- Maybe you're on the subway. its only half an hour.
- Maybe Cloudflare is down, taking half the internet with it. it'll hopefully be back up soon.
- Maybe its a fascist takeover/ thermonuclear war. Its gone. The internet is dead.
- Maybe you live in north korea. You've never had internet, never will.

These are all vastly different scenarios, but they all ask the same question:
what do you still have?

Years ago, the answer was (except the NK scenario):
- DVDs
- iPod full of MP3s
- a shelf full of books
- an encyclopedia britannica hard copy
- a box of hard drives and flashdrives with all your files

Thats quite a lot!
Contrast that to today:
- Netflix (down)
- Spotify (down)
- Kindle (down)
- Wikipedia (down)
- Google Drive/Github/Dropbox (all down)
- etc.

Jack shit. you will own nothing, that part is true, but you wont be happy.
Enough! Its time to take a stand!

## The cost of storage

Back then, when media was ours, physical storage was quite expensive.
Now, physical media is dirt cheap, and yet we choose to pay expensive subscriptions
to companies who violate our trust and privacy and own everything for us,
and cant be relied upon to be available when we need them.
Ironic isnt it?

- 2010: $10 buys a 16gb flash drive? (from what i remember, cant find stats)
- 2025: $10 buys a 1TB HDD, or $25 for NVME

Data costs are falling at exponential rates.
Experimental methods are showing we can store PETABYTES on DNA.
Or etched into diamond-silica plates that last billions of years.
So why are we so insistent on owning nothing?
On just rolling over and accepting that AI companies train on our data,
on accepting a $20 "sorry we violated your trust" settlements with NDAs attached,
(looking at you google! I didnt take the money, so im not NDA'd, fuck google!)
on having 12 different streaming services because the shows keep moving,
and none of them have that one episode that wasnt even offensive?!

Go to best buy, buy a 4TB drive for $40, and offline as much as you can!

## The north korea problem

years ago at defcon, I was inspired by: https://flashdrivesforfreedom.org/
And it truly struck me the power that information holds.
This is an attempt to build something similar, for a more western/global audience.
Information is freedom. No wonder they've convinced us they should hold it all.

## Textual information density

This year, I was struck with two opposing files.
In building a Jellyfin NAS, I was downloading 4K episodes and movies.
In a search for data sovereignty, i came accross Kiwix.
These two things led me to a conclusion.

- 120-minute 2160p movie: ~100+ GB
- All of English wikipedia ZIM-file: 110 GB

The difference in use-value and information density of text is astounding!
I cant even begin to express the value of having All of wikipedia on your phone, available whenever you need it, even in a blackout with no service.

## AI models and ollama

AI is one the greatest things humanity has ever created.
It will also be our downfall because people can no longer think for themselves,
but rather would choose to trust a machine that lies to them.

But! If we dont allow ourselves to be conned, to be vigilant and verify,
to remember it's not a truth model, its a language model, and it cannot produce truth,
only language, then there is still immense value to be had.
Its a shame that the best models are all closed source by massive, privacy-violating,
energy-hogging companies with no accountability and infinite funding.
But ollama and huggingface are partly a solution.
Download a few models for offline use.

## Docker and the homelab

It's not just about information and files.
Its also about services and tools.
We're going to cover that too so that we can become truly free.


## Conclusion

They told us technology, computers, interconnectivity, automation, AI, and the like
would set us free and bring about a communist utopia of human flourishing and the golden era.
If anything, it has enslaved us, robbed us, made us poor, unemployed, stupid, and dependent.

But this isnt a condemnation of technology. Technology really does have the potential
to free us all, and bring about true freedom for all! A techno-utopia. If we use it right.

This is a condemnation of money, and politics, and the centralization
of the worlds data and services at the expense of the many for the benefit of the very few.
And when they say humanity will live on mars, they dont mean you. They mean them. We will be
left to die, on a dying earth, with toxic air and toxic water and toxic soil.
They will sing their praises, they saved humanity, in the abstract, while the other 8 billion
of us suffer a long and miserable climate change fueled demise.

I can't fix all that. Im sick of this "if we cant fix every single issue all at once, then
you cant really call it a solution, can you?" mentality. The most i can do is hope to inspire
you to take ownership of your data back.

I hope this repo helps you to be more free.
It has for me.
